Maybe everâ€™body in the whole damn world is scared of each other.
Life is to be lived, not controlled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat.
Terror made me cruel.
The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.
It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
We were the people who were not in the papers. We lived in the blank white spaces at the edges of print. It gave us more freedom. We lived in the gaps between the stories.
It's much better to do good in a way that no one knows anything about it.
Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.
